## Unsupported sql syntax:
* Table creation & modification (now can only hard code it)
* Queries involving implicit cross-joins (select * from A, B)

## Supported syntax:
* selection & joins with predicates on pre-defined tables in main.cpp

## Implemented executors:
* sequential scan executor (multiple predicates)
* nested loop join executor
* select executor (to print query result)

## TODO List:
* Cost Estimation
* Write executor's memory context to disk when it's full
* Version Control
